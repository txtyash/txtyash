# I have moved to Codeberg

Due to privacy concerns and Github policies I have moved to codeberg. I will continue to use Github for contributions to OSS.
[Codeberg](https://codeberg.org) is not a for-profit corporation but an open community of free software enthusiasts providing a humane, non-commercial and privacy-friendly alternative to commercial services such as GitHub.
